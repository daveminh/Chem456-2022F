# Biological Target Presentation and Report

To earn a C or higher, you must complete a small research project and give a satisfactory presentation about the scientific and business prospects of developing a ligand for a biological target of your choice. To earn a B or higher, you must also complete a satisfactory report. As mentioned in the syllabus, an unsatisfactory presentation or report may be revised with 2 tokens.

## Project

The research project includes the following steps:
* Search for and select a personal target to do further research on. The target or a close homolog must have a public crystal structure in the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org). After making sure that nobody has selected the same target, enter your name and target in the Google spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OaIWLxFEssCu1uGx48hzlsdZ1-NZ3HeEpdHoZPzM1S8/edit?usp=sharing).
* Download and at least partially read at least five references related to your target.
* Perform structural analysis and visualization and at least two of the following:
    * homology modeling,
    * structural alignment,
    * or electrostatics calculations.

Some targets that you may find interesting are:
* µ-opioid receptor (which Bing is studying)
* BaxΔ2 (which Ricky is studying)
* Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), a possible cancer drug target

## Presentation

In the presentation, you should address the following questions:
* Why is the target interesting?
* What are the potential societal benefits of designing ligands that bind to the target? For example, what is the evidence, e.g. mechanistic rationale or mutations observed in the clinic, that such a ligand is likely to affect the progression of a disease?
* How suitable is the target for structure-based drug design? What structural information is available and what is the quality of this information? What is the structural or anecdotal evidence the the target is druggable? What other proteins may also be affected by a ligand that binds to the target?
* What are the business prospects of a molecule that interacts with the target? For example, how many people are affected by the related diseases and where do they live? Are there already other safe and effective treatments for the same diseases?

The presentation should be 12 minutes long, followed by 3 minutes for questions.

As a visual aid to your presentation, you should prepare a series of slides that present evidence for your answers based on your own work as well as data and figures from other sources. For example, you could perform a structural alignment between the binding site of the bacterial and human homologue of your target to highlight structural differences. This may provide evidence that a ligand that binds to the bacterial site is unlikely to also bind to the human site, or vice versa. (You may also present some calculations that do not directly address the questions.) Data and figures from other sources should be properly cited. Citations should be numbered/named on individual slides and an [ACS-style bibliography](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsguide.40303) included at the end of the slide slow. The slide show should be in Apple Keynote (.key), Microsoft Powerpoint (.ppt/,pptx), Google Slides (.gslides), or Portable Document Format (.pdf) format.

Before the first student presents, your slides should be saved in a folder within your class folder as `BiologicalTarget/BiologicalTargetPresentation.XXX`, where `XXX` is the file extension. To expedite transitions between presentations, students will all present using the instructor's laptop.

A satisfactory presentation will
* address all of the questions with sufficient evidence for the answers,
* include the required calculations,
* cite references properly, and
* be clear and concise, within the specified time slot

## Report

The report is a written version of the presentation. You should address the same questions and present evidence in the text and in figures and tables. The report should be at least three pages long and saved as a document in Apple Pages (.pages), Microsoft Word (.doc/.docx), Google Document (.gdoc), or Portable Document Format (.pdf) format.

Before 11:25am on the due date, your report should be saved in a folder within your class folder as `BiologicalTarget/BiologicalTargetReport.XXX`, where `XXX` is the file extension.

A satisfactory report will meet the same criterion as the presentation except for the last. Instead, the report should be clearly written with proper English spelling and grammar.

# Pharmaceutical Ethics Report

To earn a C or higher, you must write a satisfactory summary of the discussion related to pharmaceutical ethics. The length of the summary will depend on the grade that you are trying to earn. To be satisfactory, the summary must cover key points from the discussion and be clearly written with proper English spelling and grammar.

<!--



* **Individual Contribution Reports Survey**. All students will write two brief reports that describe their contribution to the project since the previous report. The reports will be filed as answers to an online survey. The reports will be assessed based on clarity, completeness, and credibility. They will be an important factor in the individual grade.

* **Project Portfolio**. All students are asked to write a project portfolio, which describes the skills they have developed over the course of the project. It will be an important factor in the individual contribution grade.

### Team

* **Midterm Presentation File**. Teams are required to present a midterm (a 10-15 minute project update) presentation about their project.

In the presentation, teams should review and expand on (if warranted) the scientific background information and calculations (e.g. homology modeling, structural alignment, and electrostatics) described in the individual biological target presentation. They should also describe progress on new calculations that have been performed (docking and molecular dynamics), analyses that have been performed (e.g. equilibration time, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and Markov state models), scientific understanding gained, predictions made, and what additional calculations they plan to perform and what they expect to learn from them.

All the presentations should be uploaded as a PDF file named XXXX.pdf (where XXXX is the 4-letter PDB ID) to the MidtermPresentations directory on Google Drive by midnight on March 9.

On March 10, teams will be randomly selected to present. Teams can present using either the instructor's or a member's laptop.

The presentation will be evaluated according to the following 100 point rubric: Does the presentation clearly address the scientific rationale of the project? [20 pts] Were structural alignment, electrostatics, or structural prediction calculations included and clearly explained? [10 pts] Were molecular docking calculations and analyses included and clearly described [25 pts]? Were molecular dynamics simulations and analyses included (at a minimum the equilibration time) and clearly described [25 pts]? Was the presentation clear and concise (between 10 and 15 minutes)? [10 pts] Were references properly cited? [10 pts].

* **Final Presentation File**. Teams are required to give a final presentation (a 20-30 minute overview) about their project.

In the presentation, teams should describe the scientific background information, key calculations performed, scientific understanding gained, predictions made, and what additional calculations could potentially be done what they would expect to learn from them. In addition to calculations from the previous presentation, the final presentation should include binding free energy calculations.

All the presentations should be uploaded as a PDF file named XXXX.pdf (where XXXX is the 4-letter PDB ID) to the FinalPresentations directory on Google Drive by midnight on April 27.

On April 28, two teams will be randomly selected to present. On April 30, the other two teams will present.

The presentation will be evaluated according to the following 100 point rubric: Does the presentation clearly address the background and scientific rationale of the project? [20 pts] Were calculations, including binding free energy calculations, carefully analyzed and clearly explained? [60 pts] Was the presentation clear and concise (between 20 and 30 minutes)? [10 pts] Were references properly cited? [10 pts].

* **Final Report File**. Teams are required to create a final report that captures a team’s project work in the format of a scientific journal, the Journal of Chemical Information and Modelling. The document should be prepared for submission according to [the journal's author guidelines](https://pubs.acs.org/page/jcisd8/submission/authors.html).

The report will be evaluated according to the following 100 point rubric: Does the abstract clearly describe the main findings of the study [10 pts]? Does the introduction clearly describe the rationale for the study [15 pts]? Are methods described in sufficient detail so that the study is reproducible [15 pts]? Are the results, including figures and tables, clearly presented and described [15 pts]? Does the discussion clearly explain the implications of the results in light of previous scientific knowledge [10 pts]? Are conclusions justified by the the data [10 pts]? Are references properly cited [10 pts]? Are project data stored in a well-organized format [15 pts]?

Teams are highly encouraged to submit a draft of their report by midnight on April 27. The final report is due at midnight on May 7.

* **Project Data**. Key calculation results should be stored in a well-organized format and properly documented.
