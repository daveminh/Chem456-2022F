Each team will be graded on the quality and level of effort each team member demonstrates, the participation and functioning of the students as members of a team, and the overall performance of the team, which includes its effectiveness in collaboration, and achieving the project goals, deliverables, and outcomes in a quality fashion.

Individual contribution grades will be based on the individual contribution reports and the portfolio, including their credibility. The attendance grade will be reduced by 2 points for unexcused absences and 1 for late arrival, and may be negative. The peer review will be based on completion of surveys, and the actual scores.
